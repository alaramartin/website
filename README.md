## for athena award: reflection

this was a super fun project. if I'm being honest, choosing the color scheme was the hardest part of the process (it's still going--something about the colors still seems off to me...)  
on a more serious note, the most difficult part was probably the blog page because I couldn't understand dynamic routing for the life of me. nextjs docs really helped with this one. another difficult thing was building the filter for the projects page (I completely forgot that the whole point of react is that it re-renders stuff automatically without me manually modifying the DOM and had to redo it lmao). also, i was working on a chrome browser and forgot to test on other browsers until very recently, and fixing the compatibility issues took ages
